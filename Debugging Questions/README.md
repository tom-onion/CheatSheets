#What is Debugging?

>As you learn more advance concepts of CPP, you will start making mistakes in your code. Sometimes these mistakes can be very hard to find.
This is a good time to learn the basics of Debugging - Debugging is finding and fixing errors in code.

#What is a bug now?
>A bug is an error that causes our program to generate an unexpected output that is different from our expected output or no output. What are some of the error codes you saw so far?

    -CE - Compilation error / Syntax error
    -RE - Run-time error
    -WA - Wrong answer / Logical error
    -TLE - Time limit exceeded

We will learn more about each of these errors and how to resolve them in the coming lessons.

Common Doubts ðŸ’¡

`1.What causes a compilation error?`

>A compilation error, also known as a syntax error, happens when your code violates the rules of the C++ language. Think of it like making a grammatical mistake in English; the compiler doesn't understand what you're trying to say.

`2.How to identify a runtime error?`

>A runtime error occurs while your program is running. It's often caused by things like trying to access memory that doesn't belong to you, dividing by zero, or trying to open a file that doesn't exist. The program might crash or behave unpredictably.

`What is a logical error example?`

>A logical error is a mistake in the program's logic that causes it to produce the wrong output, even though it compiles and runs without crashing.

For example, if you're trying to calculate the average of two numbers and you add them but forget to divide by 2, that's a logical error. The program will still run, but the result will be incorrect.
